The Mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript interpreter that has built-in funcionality for connecting to
and manipulating data in a MongoDB database.

When the shell starts up, it prints out a banner that includes the shell's version number as well as the
name of the database that you're connected to. It's recommended gettint into the habit of reading these
pieces of information. They're useful for detecting unexpected connections or versions $kew between servers
and shells. Generally speaking, it should be possible to use any version of the shell with any version
of the server, but occasionally 10gen adds new features either to the shell or to the server, wich
might require the agreement inversions between the two pieces. So it's a best practice to try to keep
these versions in sync.

There's two sinxates in javacript for assign variables:
  The "." (dot) notation -> is tipically thought of as being a look up properties or methods or instance variables
  withing an object.
  The "[ ]" (square bracket) notation treats the object more as a piece of data, like a dictionary, and looks up
  corresponding associations between keys and values.
